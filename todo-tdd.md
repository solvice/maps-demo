1. Establish proper testing foundation
2. Add test coverage to existing code
3. Set up TDD workflow for remaining features
4. Ensure quality gates are met going forward

## Notes

### TDD Recovery Strategy
- **Acknowledge**: Steps 1-5 were implemented without TDD
- **Retrofit**: Add comprehensive tests to existing code
- **Discipline**: Strict TDD for all new features (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- **Quality**: Meet or exceed coverage and quality targets

### Success Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 95%+ overall, 100% for critical paths
- **TDD Compliance**: All new features follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
