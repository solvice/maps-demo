# Traffic Comparison Feature - TODO Tracking

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Foundation - Traffic Utility Functions
- [ ] **Prompt 1**: Create Traffic Comparison Utilities
  - [ ] Write tests for `calculateTrafficDifference()` function
  - [ ] Write tests for `formatTrafficDifference()` function  
  - [ ] Write tests for `shouldEnableTrafficComparison()` function
  - [ ] Write tests for `createTrafficRouteConfig()` function
  - [ ] Implement all utility functions to pass tests
  - [ ] Add proper TypeScript types and exports

### Phase 2: State Management Extension
- [ ] **Prompt 2**: Extend Route State for Traffic Comparison
  - [ ] Extend `UseRouteState` interface with traffic fields
  - [ ] Add `compareTraffic` parameter to `calculateRoute` function
  - [ ] Implement dual request logic for traffic comparison
  - [ ] Update state management for both regular and traffic routes
  - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality
  - [ ] Add comprehensive tests for extended hook

### Phase 3: UI Enhancement  
- [ ] **Prompt 3**: Update Route Display for Traffic Comparison
  - [ ] Extend `RouteControlPanelProps` interface for traffic data
  - [ ] Modify route display to show traffic comparison
  - [ ] Add traffic difference highlighting and styling
  - [ ] Implement loading states for dual requests
  - [ ] Add proper accessibility and test attributes
  - [ ] Write component tests for all display scenarios

### Phase 4: Integration
- [ ] **Prompt 4**: Create Traffic Comparison Integration Logic
  - [ ] Wire traffic control button to traffic comparison logic
  - [ ] Update main page component to handle traffic comparison
  - [ ] Implement proper state propagation between components
  - [ ] Handle mode switching and cleanup
  - [ ] Add integration tests for traffic control workflow

### Phase 5: Error Handling & Polish
- [ ] **Prompt 5**: Handle Error States and Edge Cases
  - [ ] Implement partial failure handling (one request succeeds)
  - [ ] Add appropriate error messages for all scenarios
  - [ ] Create retry mechanisms for failed requests
  - [ ] Extend error types for traffic comparison failures
  - [ ] Add comprehensive error scenario tests

- [ ] **Prompt 6**: Performance Optimization and Debouncing
  - [ ] Optimize debouncing for dual requests
  - [ ] Implement proper request cancellation
  - [ ] Handle race conditions between requests
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring and optimization
  - [ ] Write performance and timing tests

- [ ] **Prompt 7**: Final Integration and E2E Testing
  - [ ] Create complete E2E test suite for traffic comparison
  - [ ] Test complete user workflows and edge cases
  - [ ] Verify cross-browser compatibility
  - [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance
  - [ ] Add final integration and documentation

## Current Priority
**Next Task**: Start with Prompt 1 - Create Traffic Comparison Utilities

## Notes and Decisions
- Maintain existing debounce timing (300ms total) for dual requests
- Use green styling for no delay, yellow/red for traffic delays  
- Format traffic difference as "+3 min" or "No delay"
- Ensure backward compatibility with all existing functionality
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns and testing approaches

## Blockers/Issues
- None currently identified

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all utility functions
- Component tests for UI changes
- Hook tests for state management extensions
- Integration tests for traffic control interaction
- E2E tests for complete user workflows
- Performance tests for dual request scenarios

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Traffic comparison works when traffic control is enabled
- [ ] Displays both regular and traffic durations with difference
- [ ] Handles all error scenarios gracefully
- [ ] Performance remains optimal with dual requests
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Code follows project patterns and standards
